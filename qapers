SYNOPSIS
    qapers [OPTION] [KEYWORD]

DESCRIPTION
    qapers is a simple bash script manages a library of PDF files by allowing
    the user to quickly find a file, open it in the default PDF viewer, and
    maintain a separate directory of annotations on each PDF file. You can use
    it to:

        * Find a PDF file in a directory where you dump all your PDFs
        * Pipe the results from the 'find' option to open a PDF of your choice
        * Open a YAML annotations file to store your notes on the PDF
        * Tag your PDFs using the YAML annotations file
        * Review your previously stored annotations
        * Export the bibliographic info of each PDF in BibTex format
        * Export parts or all of your notes on any PDF in any format you wish

    To function properly, papers needs you to store all your PDF files in PDF_DIR
    in a way that the file name contains the following information in any
    order:

        * year of publication YYYY
        * list of authors (in 'et al.' form for author lists greater than 3 authors)
        * publication name (using a consistent abbreviation convention)
        * a short key-phrase that sums up the title or main message of the article

    An example file name for the publication by Bevacqua et al. in the journal
    _Science Advances_ form Sep 2019 in which the authors study compound
    flooding in Europe in future global warming scenarios
    (https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw5531) could be:

    2019_Bevacqua_etal_SciAdv_CompoundFloodingStormSurgeEuropeClimateChange.pdf

    It's a long file name, yes, but it gets the job done. Queries on the
    author, journal name, year of publicaiton or the topics 'CompundFlooding',
    'ClimateChange', 'Climate', 'Flooding', etc. would show this file.

    A list of scientific journal abbreviations can be found here:
